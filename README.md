# Demo Az900-Simulator.

Demo Az900-Simulator is a Demo simulator to prepare for the microsoft Az-900 Azure Fundamentals certification exam based on the questions and answers in the repository Ditectrev/Microsoft-Azure-AZ-900-Microsoft-Azure-Fundamentals-Exam-Questions-Answers, and since there was no way how to practise those questions without seeing the correct answers that were present there and for testing the level of preparation, i thought of creating this simulator through the python programming language, using WebScraping and Regex.

# Instructions.

You can run the simulator through Visual Studio Code or Atom or other code editors, giving the path to the az900github_html.txt file in the **filepath** variable that is inside the **connect_to_az900** function.

Another way of running the simulator is via the command line, so you need to switch to the folder where the Az900_simulator.py file is and run this scripts.

```console
>>> python Az900_simulator.py
```
or you can put the path directly without switching

```console
>>> python path/Az900_simulator.py
```
